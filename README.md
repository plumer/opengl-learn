learning OpenGL

## 2015.1.10:

Tested the very first example in OpenGL Redbook (**8th Edition**) but failed:
> Segmentation fault (core dumped)

See `01/01-Triangles/triangles.cpp` for details.

Find another GL tutorial on [GLProgramming](http://www.glprogramming.com/red/index.html),
examples are simpler and easier to understand.
However, the contents seems **imcomplete**.

Maybe that's a rough copy of an earlier version of Redbook.
